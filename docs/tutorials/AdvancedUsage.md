### Introduction

**VISUAL:** Advanced dashboard view with AI diagnostics running.

**NARRATION:**
"Welcome to the Advanced Usage tutorial for MCP Doctor. This guide is designed for experienced users who want to leverage the full power of MCP Doctor's capabilities. We'll explore AI-powered diagnostics in depth, custom configurations, advanced repair techniques, performance optimization, security considerations, and command-line usage. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to handle complex MCP server environments with confidence."

### AI-Powered Diagnostics Deep Dive

**VISUAL:** AI analysis process visualization, log preprocessing, prompt generation, and repair suggestions.

**NARRATION:**
"MCP Doctor's integration with Claude AI provides powerful diagnostic capabilities beyond traditional rule-based systems. Let's look at how this works behind the scenes.

When you initiate an AI-powered analysis, MCP Doctor first collects and preprocesses relevant logs and configuration data. This preprocessing extracts key patterns, timestamps, and error contexts to create a comprehensive view of the system state.

The system then generates a detailed prompt that contains the preprocessed data, known issues, and specific instructions for Claude to analyze. The prompt is carefully engineered to focus Claude on the most relevant aspects of the problem while providing enough context for accurate diagnosis.

When Claude responds, MCP Doctor parses the analysis, extracting specific repair suggestions, confidence levels, and explanations. These are then mapped to actionable fixes that can be applied to your system.

Let's compare a standard repair with an AI-powered one to see the difference in approach and effectiveness..."

### Custom Configuration Management

**VISUAL:** Configuration file editing, structure overview, environment variables.

**NARRATION:**
"For advanced users, direct access to configuration files provides greater control and customization. MCP Doctor stores its main configuration in a structured JSON format at [location varies by platform].

Let's examine the structure of this file. You'll notice sections for general settings, client-specific configurations, backup preferences, monitoring intervals, and AI integration settings. While MCP Doctor's interface covers most common settings, manual editing allows for advanced customizations.

When editing configurations manually, always use MCP Doctor's backup feature first. This ensures you can easily restore a working configuration if needed.

Environment variables can override certain configuration settings, which is particularly useful in development environments or when testing different configurations..."

### Advanced Repair Techniques

**VISUAL:** Advanced repair UI, manual intervention processes, repair logs, rollback options.

**NARRATION:**
"While MCP Doctor's automated repairs handle most common issues, advanced scenarios may require manual intervention or multi-stage approaches.

From the Repair tab, click 'Advanced Options' to access extended repair controls. Here, you can see individual repair steps that would normally run automatically, allowing you to execute them individually or modify their parameters.

For complex issues, staged repairs let you address problems sequentially. For example, when dealing with both configuration and permission issues, you might fix the configuration first, test the system, then address permissions separately.

When a repair requires elevated permissions, MCP Doctor can generate the necessary commands for you to run with administrator or sudo privileges. Let's demonstrate this with a repair that needs to modify system paths.

If a repair doesn't produce the expected results, the Rollback feature provides a safety net. From the History tab, select a repair operation and click 'Rollback' to revert the changes. MCP Doctor uses the backups created before each repair to ensure accurate restoration.

For recurring or specialized repairs, you can create custom repair scripts using the Script Editor. These JavaScript-based scripts have access to MCP Doctor's repair APIs while allowing custom logic."

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**VISUAL:** Performance dashboard, resource usage graphs, configuration optimization screen.

**NARRATION:**
"MCP Doctor includes advanced performance monitoring that helps you optimize your MCP server environment. Let's explore these capabilities.

In the Monitoring tab, click 'Advanced Metrics' to access detailed performance data. Here you can see CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network activity for each MCP server process. The timeline view helps identify patterns and anomalies over time.

Pay particular attention to memory usage patterns—MCP servers can experience memory leaks under certain conditions. The leak detection feature, found under 'Analysis Tools,' can identify potential memory issues before they impact performance.

Process priority management allows you to allocate system resources appropriately. For critical MCP servers, you can assign higher priorities to ensure they receive adequate CPU time, even under system load.

Let's look at startup optimization. The Startup Analyzer shows the initialization sequence of your MCP servers, highlighting potential bottlenecks. Common issues include unnecessary dependencies, sequential operations that could be parallelized, and inefficient configuration loading.

You can also set up scheduled maintenance tasks through the 'Maintenance' tab. These automated tasks can include log rotation, temporary file cleanup, and periodic health checks, helping maintain optimal performance over time."

### Security Considerations

**VISUAL:** Security settings screen, permission management, encryption settings, audit logs.

**NARRATION:**
"Security is critical when working with MCP servers, especially in production environments. MCP Doctor provides several advanced security features to protect your systems.

Let's start with permission management. Under 'Security Settings,' you can define granular permissions for different aspects of your MCP environment. The principle of least privilege applies here—grant only the permissions necessary for each component to function.

API key management is particularly important for Claude integration. MCP Doctor stores API keys in your system's secure credential store—Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, and the SecretService API on Linux. Never store API keys in plain text configuration files.

For network security, you can configure encryption settings for communication between MCP Doctor and your servers. Enable TLS for all connections, and use certificate pinning for additional security in high-sensitivity environments.

The Audit Log feature, found under 'Reports,' maintains a detailed record of all actions performed by MCP Doctor, including repairs, configuration changes, and access attempts. This is invaluable for compliance requirements and security investigations.

Data handling policies can be configured to control what information is collected, how long it's retained, and whether it's shared with external services like Claude AI. For sensitive environments, you can enable local-only mode, which prevents any data from leaving your system."

### Command Line Interface

**VISUAL:** Terminal window showing CLI commands, scripting examples, automation workflows.

**NARRATION:**
"MCP Doctor's command-line interface provides powerful automation capabilities for advanced users. The CLI is available in the PATH after installation, or you can find it in the installation directory.

Let's start with some basic commands. 'mcpdoctor status' shows the current health of all detected MCP clients, similar to the dashboard view. 'mcpdoctor diagnose' performs a comprehensive analysis and outputs results in JSON format, which is perfect for scripting.

For repairs, 'mcpdoctor repair' automatically fixes detected issues, while 'mcpdoctor repair --dry-run' shows what would be fixed without making changes. You can target specific clients with the '--client' flag, like 'mcpdoctor repair --client=claude-desktop'.

The CLI really shines in headless environments or for automation. Here's an example of integrating MCP Doctor into a startup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Start MCP servers
start_mcp_servers

# Wait for startup
sleep 5

# Check health and repair if needed
mcpdoctor status --json > status.json
if [ $(jq '.overall == "healthy"' status.json) == "false" ]; then
  mcpdoctor repair --auto-confirm
fi
```

For CI/CD pipelines, the '--ci' flag ensures non-interactive operation and standardized output formats. The exit code indicates success or failure, making it easy to integrate with build systems."

### Troubleshooting Advanced Issues

**VISUAL:** Troubleshooting wizards, log analysis tools, dependency graphs, network diagnostics.

**NARRATION:**
"Let's explore advanced troubleshooting techniques for challenging MCP server issues.

Startup failures can be particularly difficult to diagnose. The Startup Debugger, accessible via 'Tools > Advanced > Startup Debugger', provides a detailed trace of the initialization process, capturing environment variables, command arguments, and early log output before standard logging begins.

For configuration corruption, MCP Doctor includes a Configuration Analyzer that can detect syntax errors, invalid values, and inconsistencies across related configuration files. You can access this tool via 'Tools > Configuration > Analyze'.

Advanced log analysis goes beyond pattern matching. The Log Explorer feature provides interactive filtering, timeline correlation, and anomaly detection. This helps identify subtle patterns that might indicate underlying issues not captured by standard error messages.

Network connectivity issues often manifest as timeouts or sporadic failures. The Network Diagnostic Tool can test connectivity, DNS resolution, and latency to dependent services. For MCP servers accessing external APIs, this can quickly identify network-related problems.

Dependency resolution is critical when MCP servers rely on external libraries or tools. The Dependency Analyzer creates a graph of all required components, verifying their presence and version compatibility. This is particularly useful when upgrading or migrating servers."

### Integration with Development Workflows

**VISUAL:** IDE integration, CI/CD pipeline visualization, development environment setup.

**NARRATION:**
"MCP Doctor integrates seamlessly with development workflows, helping maintain consistent MCP environments across development, testing, and production.

For local development, the VS Code and JetBrains extensions provide MCP server status directly in your IDE. You can start, stop, and monitor servers without switching contexts, and get immediate feedback when code changes affect server behavior.

In CI/CD pipelines, MCP Doctor's CLI can validate environment configuration before deployment. This example GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates how to incorporate MCP Doctor checks:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check MCP environment
    run: |
      mcpdoctor diagnose --ci
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "MCP environment validation failed"
        exit 1
      fi
```

Version compatibility management is crucial when developing with MCP servers. The Compatibility Matrix, accessible via 'Tools > Compatibility', shows which MCP client versions work with specific library versions, helping avoid deployment issues.

For release validation, the Pre-flight Check tool provides a comprehensive verification of your environment before production deployment. It tests configuration, dependencies, permissions, and network connectivity to ensure smooth operation in production."
