# Security Audit Checklist

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Review all API key storage implementations
- [ ] Verify secure storage of credentials
- [ ] Check for least privilege principle in file operations
- [ ] Verify proper permission checks before sensitive operations
- [ ] Audit third-party authentication implementations

## Data Security
- [ ] Verify sensitive data is not logged in plain text
- [ ] Check for proper handling of config files with credentials
- [ ] Confirm backup files are properly secured
- [ ] Verify temporary files are properly cleaned up
- [ ] Check for secure data deletion practices

## Dependency Security
- [ ] Scan all dependencies for vulnerabilities (npm audit)
- [ ] Review third-party library usage and necessity
- [ ] Verify dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- [ ] Check for abandoned or unmaintained dependencies
- [ ] Validate license compliance for all dependencies

## Input Validation
- [ ] Verify all user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Check for input sanitization before file system operations
- [ ] Validate all configuration file inputs
- [ ] Check for proper handling of unexpected inputs
- [ ] Verify path traversal prevention in file operations

## API Security
- [ ] Review Claude API implementation for security issues
- [ ] Check for proper error handling that doesn't leak information

- [ ] Look for potential memory leaks
- [ ] Check for secure random number generation where needed
- [ ] Validate proper disposal of resources

## Application Security
- [ ] Verify secure application startup procedure
- [ ] Review self-test implementation for security gaps
- [ ] Check for proper handling of unexpected crashes
- [ ] Validate secure implementation of all repair procedures
