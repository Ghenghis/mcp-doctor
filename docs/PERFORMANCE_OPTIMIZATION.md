# Performance Optimization Checklist

## Application Startup
- [ ] Measure cold start time
- [ ] Optimize import order in main process
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical modules
- [ ] Reduce bundle size with tree shaking
- [ ] Minimize renderer process initialization

## Runtime Performance
- [ ] Profile CPU usage during main operations
- [ ] Monitor memory consumption patterns
- [ ] Optimize expensive operations with caching
- [ ] Implement proper garbage collection hints
- [ ] Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## File Operations
- [ ] Implement streaming for large log files
- [ ] Use async file operations throughout
- [ ] Batch file operations where possible
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all I/O
- [ ] Use appropriate buffer sizes for file operations

## UI Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure main thread is not blocked during operations
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for all long-running tasks
- [ ] Optimize DOM updates in renderer process
- [ ] Measure and optimize component render times
- [ ] Implement virtualization for large lists

## Network Operations
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Compress request/response data
- [ ] Implement proper timeout handling
- [ ] Cache responses where appropriate

## Database/Storage
- [ ] Index frequently queried fields
- [ ] Optimize query patterns
- [ ] Implement batch operations for multiple related changes
- [ ] Use appropriate storage strategy for different data types
- [ ] Implement data pruning strategy for logs/history

## AI Integration
- [ ] Minimize API calls to Claude API
- [ ] Optimize prompt size and structure
- [ ] Implement client-side caching for similar queries
- [ ] Process logs in chunks to avoid memory issues
- [ ] Implement background processing for large files

## Testing Methodology
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Create automated performance regression tests
- [ ] Test on minimum spec hardware
- [ ] Benchmark against previous versions
- [ ] Measure performance under various load conditions

## Documentation
- [ ] Document optimization techniques applied
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for performance issues
- [ ] Document resource requirements
- [ ] Provide tuning recommendations for different environments
- [ ] Track performance metrics across versions
